🛠 Tech Stack
Python 3.x

Streamlit (for web apps)

Basic standard libraries: random, time, sys, etc.

💡 How to Run

# Run Python files
python filename.py

# Run Streamlit apps
streamlit run app_name.py

To stop a Python file running in the terminal, you can use:

# ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcut
Most common way:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Ctrl + C
This sends a KeyboardInterrupt to the program.

Works for scripts stuck in an infinite loop, or waiting for input.

# 🛑 Other Options (if Ctrl+C doesn't work)
1. Force Quit the Terminal Tab/Window
Just close the terminal.

Or stop the terminal session (right-click → close, or use the terminal's close button).
