To stop a Python file running in the terminal, you can use:

‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcut
Most common way:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Ctrl + C
This sends a KeyboardInterrupt to the program.

Works for scripts stuck in an infinite loop, or waiting for input.

üõë Other Options (if Ctrl+C doesn't work)
1. Force Quit the Terminal Tab/Window
Just close the terminal.

Or stop the terminal session (right-click ‚Üí close, or use the terminal's close button).

2. Find and Kill the Python Process (Advanced)
bash
Copy
Edit
# Show running Python processes
ps aux | grep python

# Then kill by PID (replace 1234 with actual PID)
kill 1234
Or force kill:

bash
Copy
Edit
kill -9 1234
Let me know if you're using a specific environment (VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter, etc.) and I can guide you for that too.
